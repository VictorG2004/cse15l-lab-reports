# Lab Report 3
## Researching Commands
I will be researching grep and looking for alternate ways I can use this command.
**grep -r**
grep -r allows users to find a specific string in a directory and in other subdirectories.
* I used grep -r to find a broad word and see if that would work or break my computer this was the result when i used command
grep -r "and":

Here we see that it is going through all the files in the technical/ directory. It is not clear through picture but it has files from the biomed, plos, 911report and government directories.
* I also used grep -r to look for a more specific word, this is what happened when I searched for grep -r "mitochondria":

Here we can see more clearly that this function searches through both biomed and plos files.
